# in_small_steps
Teaching myself programming in small steps. Each folder should be a FINISHED small project.

WHAT IS THIS?
This is a collection of small applications (usually written with C++/Qt/QML, but not always).
Each folder in the root directory should contain a small and FUNCTIONING project.
Those projects don't always contain something practically applicable in the real world, but that's not their purpose.
The real purpose here is to study some aspects of C++ or programming in general.
If the app in some folder doesn't work, it means it's not finished yet.
All the future apps in this project should be described here in this file.

1 - Calculator (MVC model)
A calculator based on Model-View-Controller pattern. 
The goal here is not to create a calculator per se, but to undestand the basics of MVC and SOLID.
Calculator should contain a "Number" field, number buttons, a comma, equal sign, reset buttons, and the basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/).
Nothing fancy is expected here. Do this in MVC, get SOLID where you can, and you're good to go.
NOTE TO SELF [TO REMOVE AFTER RESOLVED]: 
1. Pure virtual method called error because of the qmlConnector;
2. Without qmlConnector (at all), app crashes. Investigate why and maybe you'll find the problem behind the bug.

CURRENT LEARNING PLAN:
- Try to commit every day [doesn't matter how small the commit is]
- First, finish the MVC Calculator app; <== I'm here currently
- Second, create one app in several languages: C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby. Actual purpose and contents of the app TBD.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: the app should have one different module in each language.
- Third, create a small game (most probably an Arkanoid clone or a fifteen game) in C#/Unity.
- Then, try to do the same with some other language/framework/whatever (Unreal Engine 4?).
- Start a big project (most probably either a roguelite or the file manager).
