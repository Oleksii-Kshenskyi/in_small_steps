# in_small_steps
Teaching myself programming in small steps. Each folder should be a FINISHED small project.

WHAT IS THIS?
This is a collection of small applications (usually written with C++/Qt/QML, but not always).
Each folder in the root directory should contain a small and FUNCTIONING project.
Those projects don't always contain something practically applicable in the real world, but that's not their purpose.
The real purpose here is to study some aspects of C++ or programming in general.
If the app in some folder doesn't work, it means it's not finished yet.
All the future apps in this project should be described here in this file.

1 - Calculator (MVC model)
A calculator based on Model-View-Controller pattern. 
The goal here is not to create a calculator per se, but to undestand the basics of MVC and SOLID.
Calculator should contain a "Number" field, number buttons, a comma, equal sign, reset buttons, and the basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/).
Nothing fancy is expected here. Do this in MVC, get SOLID where you can, and you're good to go.
CALC MVC TO DO:
Deal with adding new Setter Rules:
- Either by move constructing (addRule() argument would be an rvalue reference and probably should be using std::move inside);
  Get QScopedPointer back. It works with move construction as of Qt 5.9. UPDATE: Or does it? 
  No clear move constructor in documentation. Will have to investigate this myself.
- Or by introducing templated arguments and constructing Setter Rules inside the function.
Make sure to try your best with the move construction first though. This is a much better resolution!
