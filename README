# in_small_steps
Teaching myself programming in small steps. Each folder should be a FINISHED small project.

WHAT IS THIS?
This is a collection of small applications (usually written with C++/Qt/QML, but not always).
Each folder in the root directory should contain a small and FUNCTIONING project.
Those projects not always contain something practically applicable in the real world, but that's not their purpose.
The real purpose here is to study some aspects of C++ or programming in general.
If the app in some folder doesn't work, it means it's not finished yet.
