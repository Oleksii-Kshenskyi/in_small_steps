# in_small_steps
Teaching myself programming in small steps. Each folder should be a FINISHED small project.

WHAT IS THIS?
This is a collection of small applications (usually written with C++/Qt/QML, but not always).
Each folder in the root directory should contain a small and FUNCTIONING project.
Those projects don't always contain something practically applicable in the real world, but that's not their purpose.
The real purpose here is to study some aspects of C++ or programming in general.
If the app in some folder doesn't work, it means it's not finished yet.
All the future apps in this project should be described here in this file.

1 - Calculator (MVC pattern)
A calculator based on Model-View-Controller pattern. 
The goal here is not to create a calculator per se, but to undestand the basics of MVC and SOLID.
Calculator should contain a "Number" field, number buttons, a comma, equal sign, reset buttons, and the basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/).
Nothing fancy is expected here. Do this in MVC, get SOLID where you can, and you're good to go.
When the change to calculator is done, increment the 3rd number. When some part is done, increment 2nd number. When the whole project is done,
increment 1st number.
NOTE TO SELF [TO REMOVE AFTER RESOLVED]: 
  - Operations are performed correctly at the moment, however, the long-term behavior still requires much refactoring;
  - Operation sequence and app behavior should be fully conformant to the standard MS Windows calculator.
  - After solving the operation sequence problem:
    a. Introduce floating point logic;
    b. Implement CA button;

2 - Effective Modern Cpp
This is a project created for the purpose of learning stuff from said book. Try to create a small program for each item to use it the way the book
wants you to, and to train the principle through practice.
Each item contains its own folder with a small project inside. When the project is updated, increment 3rd number. When the item is done, increment 
2nd number. When the whole book is done, increment 1st number.

CURRENT LEARNING PLAN:
- Try to commit every day [doesn't matter how small the commit is]
- First, finish the MVC Calculator app; <== I'm here currently
- Second, create one app in several languages: C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby. Actual purpose and contents of the app TBD.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: the app should have one different module in each language.
- Third, create a small game (most probably an Arkanoid clone or a fifteen game) in C#/Unity.
- Then, try to do the same with some other language/framework/whatever (Unreal Engine 4?).
- Start a big project (most probably either a roguelite or the file manager).

SEPARATE PLAN:
- Until new job is found, studying for 6h every day. Currently it involves learning the Effective Modern C++ book.
